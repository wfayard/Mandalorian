16 Channel Relays "YAML" 16Channel analog input with MQTT, "Arduino"
I am using 16 channel relay boards to control lights at my house. I used an ESP8266MCU programed in ESPHome in HA to trasfer the firmware.
I have used Arduino code to control a mutiplexer that allows one to read 16 analog inputs on an ESP8266MCU.
I have also included code I used to get the MQTT into Home Assistant and usable as a sensor.
None of this is professional, I hardly know what i'm doing but all this works, at least for me.
